## Mutations

Use mutations for asynchronous operations with side effects:

```ts
import { useMutation } from '@pinia/colada'

const createTodo = useMutation({
  mutation: (text: string) => api.todos.create({ text }),
})
```

- `mutate(variables)` starts the operation and handles the rejected promise through mutation state and hooks.
- `mutateAsync(variables)` returns a promise; use it when surrounding control flow must await or catch the result.
- Keep mutation inputs explicit so `variables` and hook arguments remain useful and typed.
- Use `state.status` for result state and `asyncStatus` for active work.
- Configure `onMutate`, `onSuccess`, `onError`, and `onSettled` according to the installed version.
- Hooks may return promises. Awaiting invalidation in a hook keeps the mutation loading until dependent data is refreshed.

Mutations are not global by default. Add a mutation key when another component needs to find matching entries through the mutation cache.

## Reusable mutations

Use `defineMutationOptions()` to share typed mutation configuration and `defineMutation()` when callers should share a mutation composable with extra state or methods:

```ts
export const updateContactOptions = defineMutationOptions({
  key: ['contacts', 'update'],
  mutation: (input: UpdateContactInput) => api.contacts.update(input),
})

export const useUpdateContact = defineMutation(() =>
  useMutation(updateContactOptions),
)
```

Use the object form of `defineMutation()` when only organized reusable options are needed and the installed version supports it. Call a defined mutation within component setup, a store, or an active effect scope. Do not invoke it at module top level or from a later callback without an owning scope.

## Query cache

Resolve the cache in an injection context:

```ts
import { useQueryCache } from '@pinia/colada'

const queryCache = useQueryCache()
```

Use key factories shared with query definitions. Common operations include:

```ts
queryCache.getQueryData(contactKeys.detail(id))
queryCache.setQueryData(contactKeys.detail(id), updatedContact)
queryCache.invalidateQueries({ key: contactKeys.root })
queryCache.invalidateQueries({ key: contactKeys.detail(id), exact: true })
queryCache.cancelQueries({ key: contactKeys.detail(id) })
```

- Prefix filters include descendant keys; use `exact: true` for one entry.
- Invalidation marks matching entries stale and normally refetches active matches.
- Inactive invalidated entries refresh when they become active.
- Pass the installed version's refetch mode only when inactive entries must also refetch immediately.
- Prefer invalidation to removal. Remove entries only for deliberate eviction, and cancel in-flight work first.
- Never replace internal cache structures directly.

Use direct writes when the server response already contains authoritative updated data. Use invalidation when related server state may have changed beyond the returned object.

## Prefetching

Prefetch with the query cache and the same defined options used by the eventual component:

```ts
await queryCache.refresh(queryCache.ensure(contactQuery(id)))
```

Prefetch likely next routes or hover targets only when the extra request has a clear UX benefit. Fresh cached data should prevent an unnecessary duplicate request.

## Mutation consistency strategies

Choose the narrowest strategy that preserves consistency:

1. Set exact cache data from the mutation response when it is complete and authoritative.
2. Invalidate affected query prefixes when the server may have changed derived lists or aggregates.
3. Apply an optimistic update only when immediate feedback matters and rollback is reliable.
4. Combine a direct response write with invalidation when progressive correctness is useful.

Example using authoritative response data and invalidation:

```ts
const updateContact = useMutation({
  mutation: (input: UpdateContactInput) => api.contacts.update(input),
  onSuccess(contact) {
    queryCache.setQueryData(contactKeys.detail(contact.id), contact)
  },
  onSettled(_data, _error, input) {
    return queryCache.invalidateQueries({ key: contactKeys.list(input.filters) })
  },
})
```

Adjust hook parameters to the locally installed declarations.

## Optimistic update checklist

An optimistic cache update needs all of the following:

1. Snapshot the previous value.
2. Cancel related in-flight queries that could overwrite it.
3. Construct a complete optimistic value without mutating cached objects in place.
4. Write the optimistic value.
5. Return rollback context from `onMutate`.
6. On error, restore only if the optimistic value is still current; another mutation may have superseded it.
7. On success, merge or replace with the server response.
8. On settled, invalidate the relevant keys to reconcile with the server.

```ts
const patchContact = useMutation({
  mutation: api.contacts.patch,
  async onMutate(input) {
    const key = contactKeys.detail(input.id)
    const previous = queryCache.getQueryData<Contact>(key)
    const optimistic = previous && { ...previous, ...input }

    await queryCache.cancelQueries({ key, exact: true })

    if (optimistic) {
      queryCache.setQueryData(key, optimistic)
    }

    return { key, previous, optimistic }
  },
  onError(_error, _input, context) {
    if (
      context.optimistic &&
      queryCache.getQueryData(context.key) === context.optimistic
    ) {
      queryCache.setQueryData(context.key, context.previous)
    }
  },
  onSuccess(contact, _input, context) {
    queryCache.setQueryData(context.key, contact)
  },
  onSettled(_data, _error, _input, context) {
    return queryCache.invalidateQueries({ key: context.key, exact: true })
  },
})
```

Avoid optimistic updates when rollback would be ambiguous, the server applies complex transformations, or concurrent edits cannot be reconciled safely. A pending UI row driven by mutation `variables` is often simpler than modifying the cache.

## Concurrent mutation policy

An identity check prevents an older rollback from overwriting a newer cached object, but it does not make overlapping mutations fully ordered. Choose and document one policy for operations that touch the same entity or list:

- **Serialize locally:** queue same-resource mutations and start the next only after settlement. Use when latency is acceptable and the client is the only writer.
- **Last response wins:** allow overlap and accept response order. Use only when operations are commutative or overwrites are harmless.
- **Client sequence:** attach a monotonically increasing local revision and ignore responses older than the current revision. This protects one client but not conflicts from other clients.
- **Server concurrency control:** send an ETag, version, or revision and handle conflicts explicitly. Prefer this for multi-user edits or valuable data.
- **Reconcile from server:** invalidate after every settlement and treat server state as final. This is safest when temporary UI reordering is acceptable.

When a mutation affects both list and detail entries, snapshot and guard each touched value independently. Do not restore an entire list if a newer mutation changed a different item. Test success and failure in both completion orders for two overlapping operations.
